============

This extension for Contao Open Source CMS enables users to change their mailbox password in the frontend of the website.


###How does the extension works?

In the backend, you can easily assign an existing mailbox account to one or more FrontendUsers. As soon as the logged in FrontendUser visits the site with the embedded module, he finds a form where he can change the password for one of the assigned mailbox accounts.


###This extension is in development!

I'm currently working on this extension, so please do not use this developer version for productional websites.
